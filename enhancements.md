# Enhancement Ideas for Deep Research Tool

## Research Report Enhancements

1. **Robust Detailed Learnings with Insight Detail Parameter**:
   - Implement an "Insight Detail" parameter (scale 1-10) to control the depth and comprehensiveness of research insights
   - Transform the learning extraction process to generate detailed, multi-page learnings instead of concise summaries
   - Scale token limits based on the Insight Detail parameter (1000-10000 tokens per learning)
   - Adjust the number of learnings extracted based on the detail level
   - Enhance the report generation process to create comprehensive reports (3-50 pages) based on detailed learnings
   - Structure detailed learnings with titles, content, sources, and key points
   - Provide appropriate prompting based on the selected detail level
   - Create a foundation of 100-150 pages of detailed content for high-detail reports

## PubMed Integration Enhancements

1. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - If a MeSH term search returns no results, automatically try a less restrictive search
   - Implement a tiered approach: start with high restrictiveness, then medium, then low if needed
   - As a last resort, fall back to text word search without MeSH terms
   - Add logging to track which fallback level produced results

2. **MeSH Term Visualization**:
   - Show users the converted MeSH terms before executing the search
   - Allow users to edit or refine the MeSH terms if needed
   - Provide explanations of what each MeSH term means and how it affects the search
   - Include a "learn more about MeSH" link for users unfamiliar with the concept

3. **Advanced PubMed Filters**:
   - Add options for filtering by publication date (e.g., last 1 year, 5 years, 10 years)
   - Filter by journal impact factor or journal tier
   - Filter by study type (e.g., clinical trials, meta-analyses, reviews)
   - Filter by author or institution
   - Allow combining multiple filters for precise searches

4. **Citation Export**:
   - Add functionality to export citations in different formats (BibTeX, EndNote, RIS, etc.)
   - Allow users to select which citations to export
   - Provide options to include abstracts, DOIs, and other metadata in the export
   - Support batch export of multiple citations

5. **Relevance Scoring**:
   - Implement a scoring system to rank PubMed articles by relevance to the research query
   - Consider factors like citation count, journal impact factor, and recency
   - Allow users to sort results by different criteria (relevance, date, citation count)
   - Provide visual indicators of relevance (e.g., star ratings or color coding)

6. **Interactive Results Exploration**:
   - Create a more interactive way to explore PubMed results
   - Implement a feature to find related articles based on a selected article
   - Visualize connections between articles (e.g., citation networks)
   - Allow users to save interesting articles to a "reading list"

7. **Semantic Search Enhancement**:
   - Implement semantic search capabilities to find conceptually related articles
   - Use embeddings or other NLP techniques to understand the meaning behind queries
   - Find articles that discuss similar concepts even if they use different terminology
   - Provide "concept clusters" to help users explore related research areas

8. **User Preferences for MeSH Terms**:
   - Allow users to save preferred MeSH term configurations for different types of searches
   - Create domain-specific presets (e.g., for cardiology, oncology, neurology)
   - Let users exclude certain MeSH terms that aren't relevant to their research
   - Implement a "favorite MeSH terms" feature for frequently used terms

9. **Integration with Reference Management Tools**:
   - Add direct export to popular reference management tools like Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote
   - Implement a feature to check if articles are already in the user's reference library
   - Support automatic organization of references into collections or folders

10. **Enhanced Abstract Analysis**:
    - Provide AI-generated summaries of abstracts
    - Highlight key findings and methodologies
    - Extract and display statistical significance and effect sizes from studies
    - Identify potential limitations or biases in the research

   - Create a dashboard showing current and past research projects
   - Display statistics on searches performed, articles found, and reports generated
   - Include a timeline of research activities
   - Allow users to organize research into projects or categories

3. **Interactive Query Builder**:
   - Develop a visual query builder with drag-and-drop components
   - Provide suggestions for related terms as users type
   - Show real-time feedback on how query changes might affect results
   - Include templates for common research patterns

4. **Visual Research Progress**:
   - Create a visual representation of the research process
   - Show breadth and depth parameters as an expandable tree or network
   - Animate the exploration process as new queries are generated

   - Visualize the distribution of article types, journals, or authors

6. **Split-Screen View**:
   - Develop a split-screen interface showing search results and report drafting side by side
   - Allow users to drag content from results directly into the report
